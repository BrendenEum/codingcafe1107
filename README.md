# Rotman Coding Cafe Tutorial on Web Scraping in R

This repository contains material for the Rotman Coding Cafe tutorial on November 7, 2024.

The **Powerpoint presentation** contains information about the ethics of web scraping, avoiding legal issues, and a basic introduction to reading HTML code.

The **student workbook** is an R markdown file for students to work through some web scraping examples.

The **answer key** is an R markdown file that contains the answers to the exercises in the student workbook. If you're looking for some code to reference on your own web scraping project, I'd recommend looking through this answer key since it is thoroughly commented.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, feel free to email me at b.eum@rotman.utoronto.edu!
